              If you subscribe to become a member of the Company Apps (a
              &quot;Subscription&quot;), we will charge the applicable Subscription Fee.
              At times, we may offer trial periods during which customers
              register for a Subscription and enjoy all the Subscription benefits
              on a trial basis. If you sign up for a trial period and cancel
              during the trial period, the payment information provided will not
              be billed. If you do not cancel during the trial period, we will
              automatically charge the applicable Subscription Fee to the
              payment method that you have supplied during the registration
              process.
            </p>
            <p>
              You may cancel your Subscription and request a refund only within
              thirty (30) days after your payment has been processed. A
              Subscription may be cancelled for the upcoming month, but refunds
              will not be given for prior months.
            </p>
            <p>
              Annual or Monthly Subscriptions will automatically be renewed at
              the end of the Subscription term unless: (1) you cancel your
              renewal during your Subscription period; or (2) you request a
              cancellation within 30 days after your renewal payment has been
              processed. Monthly Subscription can be cancelled for the upcoming
              month, but no refund will be given for prior months.
